## Overview
AEROLABS (*Autonomous Ecological Research & Orbital Laboratory for Agricultural Bio-Security*) is a strategic orbital infrastructure proposal designed to solve the "First-Generation Food Paradox" in Mars colonization. Rather than relying on high-risk ground-based agriculture upon arrival, AEROLABS utilizes a swarm of autonomous orbital biological labs to cultivate, process, and stockpile a diverse 2.6-year food supply before the crew ever touches down.

## Key Innovation
The project identifies that early Martian ground colonies are too vulnerable to dust storms, radiation, and mechanical failure to support reliable agriculture. By moving production to a Variable-Rate Centrifuge Swarm in orbit, we ensure bio-security, gravity-agnostic fluid physics, and a guaranteed caloric surplus for the first 10-person crew.

## Technical Specifications
- Hull Material: Aluminum Alloy 7075-T7351 (High stress-corrosion resistance).
- Power System: 11 kW via Flexible Array Concentrator Technology solar arrays.
- Cultivation: High-pressure Aeroponic Racks with AI-driven nutrient misting.
- Redundancy: Distributed "Swarm" configuration to prevent single-point biological failure.

## Nutritional Mission Profiles
The mission is divided into three distinct satellite profiles to ensure holistic crew health:
- Baseload Profile (60% Swarm allocation): High-calorie staples (Sweet Potatoes, Microalgae Powder (Chlorella)).
- Lipid Profile (20% Swarm allocation): Essential fatty acids and proteins (Dwarf Soybeans, Microalgae Powder (Schizochytrium)).
- Sensory Profile (20% Swarm allocation): Psychological well-being and micronutrients (Dwarf Chilies, Strawberries).
